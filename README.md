#  Movies Kotlin Kata 
Movies Kotlin kata for practice Clean Architecture and Best Practices in Android using Kotlin, implemented by Jorge Sánchez (Xurxodev)

## Kata 3

- We are here to practice Clean architecture with domain and data layers.
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Considerations 

Master branch contains already solved katas, exists a branch for every kata.

## Getting started

This repository contains an Android application to show movies information:

Initial state in this branch is without presenter is ready for refactoring to mvp.

## Tasks

Your task as Android Developer is to **refactoring presentation layer to Model View Presenter**.
The recommendation for this exercise is:

  * Before starting
    1. Fork this repository and Checkout `kata_domain_data-movies` branch or download zip.
    3. Execute the application, explore it manually and make yourself familiar with the code.

  * To help you get started:
    1. Identify domain (application logic and business logic)
    2. Identify domain boundaries
    3. Create usecases or interactors and entities.
    4. Refactoring activity or fragment, presenters.
    5. Execute the app and verify that all is right
